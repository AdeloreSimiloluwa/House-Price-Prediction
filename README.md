# House-Price-Prediction
Data Science Class Project (first project work)

### Problem Statement: 

There is a new Real Estate Company in an area, and they want to find out what prices they should value their houses, what neighborhoods are best suited for what house type and quality, etc,. The task they have given the data scientist is to work through a given dataset with about 81 features like the quality of the houses, condition of the houses, if it has a pool, what is the garage size, how many rooms, etc and answer these questions:

1. How have sales been over the years?  (Using visualization)
 
2. What quality of the houses are sold in different neighborhoods? (Using visualization)
 
3. What types of houses are most prevalent in different neighborhoods? (Using visualization)
 
4. What features strongly impacts sales prices(above 60% correlation)? 
 
5. How accurately can we predict the prices of the houses based on those variables?  

**It is important to note that the major concern here is the prediction of house prices.**
